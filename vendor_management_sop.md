## Vendor Management SOP (Synthetic)

### Onboarding
- **Qualification**: Verify capability to meet spec; run pilot lots as needed.
- **Compliance**: Contracts, Incoterms, payment terms; background checks as applicable.
- **Data Setup**: Assign `vendor_id`, categories, risk and quality baselines.

### Performance Management
- **KPIs**: On-time %, Quality score, OTIF, Lead time variance, Risk score.
- **Reviews**: Monthly for high-criticality vendors; quarterly otherwise.
- **Actions**: CAPA on quality issues; expedite plans on delays; diversify if risk > threshold.

### Sourcing Strategy
- **Dual Source**: Maintain secondary vendor for high-criticality materials.
- **Incoterms**: Prefer terms that balance control and cost (FOB/FCA for domestic, CIF/FCA for international).
- **Contracts**: Capture service levels, penalty clauses, and security requirements.

### Escalations
- **Trigger**: Delayed/quality issues on critical materials, risk score > 25.
- **Process**: Supplier notification → joint recovery plan → executive review if impact > 2 production days.
